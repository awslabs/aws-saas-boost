# AWS SaaS Boost

## Overview
AWS SaaS Boost provides organizations with ready-to-use core software elements for successfully running SaaS workloads in the cloud.  Software builders can focus on preserving core intellectual property by removing the complexities of building SaaS solutions using AWS SaaS Boost.

Get a boost with tenant management, deployment automation, analytics dashboards, billing and metering, an administrative web interface, and more. This environment reduces development and experimentation time, allowing you to get your software into the hands of customers faster.

Check out our [announcement blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/transforming-your-monolith-to-saas-with-aws-saas-boost/) for a more detailed description of how you can benefit from AWS SaaS Boost.

Now, jump to the [Getting Started Guide](./docs/getting-started.md) to start working with AWS SaaS Boost today.

## Cost
You will be billed for the [various services](docs/services.md) leveraged by AWS SaaS Boost. Provisioned resources are tagged with "SaaS Boost" and each tenant's resources are also uniquely tagged to help you with [cost allocation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html).

Each tenant you onboard into an AWS SaaS Boost environment will provision more infrastructure and will increase your costs.

Note that the _optional_ Analytics and Metrics module will provision a Redshift cluster.
