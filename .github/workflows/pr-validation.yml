      # We use Corretto Java 11 for Lambda: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html
      # Currently amazon-corretto Java is not supported for GitHub actions on Ubuntu-latest. By default we're using Adopt JDK11
      #   https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/linux/Ubuntu2004-README.md
      # We may want to either switch to using an AL2 container (to give us corretto) or contribute a new JDK to the GitHub runners
      #   There is an open issue (as of 2021/06/30) requesting Corretto support: https://github.com/actions/setup-java/issues/68

      # TODO add parent pom for Java built services
      # This is... not great. We currently have no way to build all Java code with a single command. 
      # And we can't just run mvn clean compile because later modules rely on the binaries of earlier ones. 
      # Including a parent pom will solve both of the above.
